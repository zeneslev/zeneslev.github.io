## ðŸ‘‹ Welcome

My name is Matt and this is where I store my ramblings and professional projects. This blog serves as my whole digital presence. I find that traditional social media tends to isolate parts of ourselves resulting in a loss of individual wholeness.
My interests are as follows:
- Electrical Engineering
- Robotics
- Aviation
- Improvisational and Ecstatic Dance
- Powerlifting
- The Nature of Self and Reality
- Plant Medicine
- Meditation and Breathwork
- Men's work

Feel free to connect with me!
