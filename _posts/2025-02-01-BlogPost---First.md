>"The sense of being perched somewhere behind your eyes, looking out at a world that is separate from yourself—can be altered or entirely extinguished. Although such experiences of 'self-transcendence' are generally thought about in religious terms, there is nothing, in principle, irrational about them. From both a scientific and a philosophical point of view, they represent a clearer understanding of the way things are. Deepening that understanding, and repeatedly cutting through the illusion of the self, is what is meant by 'spirituality' in the context of this book."          -[Waking Up: Searching for Spirituality Without Religion](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00LWM6CAM/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1)

I read these words from Sam Harris' book in 2017 though I had no understanding what he meant, until 7 years later. I had spent nearly a decade dabbling around with meditation, trying to extract the clinical benefits: lower stress, better sleep, reducing my suffering. I couldn't develop a stable routine. Glimpses of relief here and there but ultimately frustration would get the better of me. 

# Losing "myself" for the first time
I am now in the Mayan jungle in Quintana Roo, MX, not to far from the border of Belize. I am lying on a mattress in the middle of circular thatch roof structure, a Maloka. A skylight is centered directly above me. I can see birds in the rafters. I've been here for nearly a week for several ayahuasca ceremonies. I am hardly eating and am ripped open emotionally, it feels like I am bleeding. I am exhausted and terrified of what's about to happen. 

I was told that this would be a quick journey. Two points of advice were given to me: "You are going to feel like you are dying. Just accept death. And.. don't forget to breathe". Poison extracted from the Sonoran Desert Toad, 45 milligrams of dark red powder, was presented to me in some fancy glassware sealed with an aluminum foil top. Also a metal straw. Kyle brought a torch to the bottom of the glass. I was to pierce the foil with the straw and breathe in the smoke of the vaporized powder and hold as long until given a signal.

The last thing in my visual field was smoke exiting my mouth. My heartbeat is getting louder exponentially. Fear beyond fear. Something is coming and it's overwhelming. I took what seemed to be my last breaths. "I am going to die here and nobody knows exactly where I am." And then nothing. I fell to stillness at the bottom of my last breath. I died. There is absolutely nothing, complete peace. There is a visual field of the skylight. But there is no skylight. This is an image, but there is no image. There is no time. *Words completely fail here*. The cosmic background radiation of the universe is this image of a skylight. It's always been here. There is no before nor after. Everything has been reduced to a point, and then nothing. Eternity is now.

A rogue thought pops into existence "don't forget to breathe!". Back in duality now. The body seems to automatically inhale. With the inhale, a hot blast of energy follows. WHAT IS THIS? The saturation and brightness in the visual field have been turned up past 11. With this breath, a wave of life force. Each cell of my body opens up in full orgasm. A second breath, another wave. Brilliant white light. All of the energy of the universe is dumping into me like a cosmic waterfall. With each breath, pure overwhelm. This is perfection. Pure God Perfection. Unity. Everything I've wanted is right here. A sense of familiarity. It's always been here. Full satisfaction. "Is this what new life feels like?"

20 minutes later. Breathing returning to normal. Deep love. I have just been born. Concept of self slowly returning. It's as I have previously been living through the lens of concepts. Like how in a first person video game there is a HUD (heads up display) that shows your location, stats, health points, rank, ammo. All of that information that was overlayed on my screen is now gone. There is just the appearance of world in all of it's absolute beauty. There is just bliss. Concept of self slowly returning. "There isn't any suffering. There is nothing to desire. Everything is perfect". 

1 hour later I am eating dinner with my facilitators. Back to normal now, but I feel completely free. I am still in awe.

# Nonduality
Nonduality is the knowing that there are not two separate things, a self and the world. You are one with everything and everyone. This oneness has the qualities of bliss, love, peace, freedom. You are not a separate self district from the world. That felt separateness is an illusion.
