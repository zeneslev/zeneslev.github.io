>"The sense of being perched somewhere behind your eyes, looking out at a world that is separate from yourselfâ€”can be altered or entirely extinguished. Although such experiences of 'self-transcendence' are generally thought about in religious terms, there is nothing, in principle, irrational about them. From both a scientific and a philosophical point of view, they represent a clearer understanding of the way things are. Deepening that understanding, and repeatedly cutting through the illusion of the self, is what is meant by 'spirituality' in the context of this book."     -[Waking Up: Searching for Spirituality Without Religion](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00LWM6CAM/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1)
