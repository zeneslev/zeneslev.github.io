<ul>
  <li>‚ÄúTo be free is to die to your need to be a separate self. What, then, could be constrained? Ego death, absolute surrender to the point of oneness, is the ultimate freedom. Few men ever release themselves enough to relax in this depth of freedom because they are afraid of absolutely no stress. No stress means no thoughts, no sense of protected self, no mission to accomplish. The end of the masculine game. Yet, this stress-free, unprotected end of the game is exactly what you are always seeking, through orgasm, financial killings, or winning a war. You are willing to experience lesser forms of masculine ‚Äúdeath‚Äù and ecstasy, but you are unwilling to face the death of your separate self-sense, and finally be the freedom you have only allowed yourself to taste in moments.‚Äù</li>
  <li>‚ÄúA person who denies their own essence and hides their true desires is divided and unable to relax into the full openness of love.‚Äù</li>
  <li>Your fear is the sharpest definition of your self. You should know it. You should feel it virtually constantly. Fear needs to become your friend, so that you are no longer uncomfortable with it. ‚Äî location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B01NA993PI&amp;location=500">500</a> ^ref-11446</li>
  <li>‚ÄúIf you are disconnected to your deep masculine core of purpose and consciousness, you will also be disconnected from a woman‚Äôs depth. You will only be attracted to the superficial display of a woman‚Äôs radiance‚Äù</li>
  <li>‚ÄúThe play of your body wanting her body is the most obvious hoax of fulfillment.‚Äù</li>
  <li>‚ÄúYour ultimate desire is for the union of consciousness with its own luminosity, wherein all appearance is recognized as your deep, blissful nature, and there is only One. Your desire for union with a woman is a stepped-down version of this ultimate spiritual need. You can use your desire as a doorway to spiritual oneness. Magnify your desiring to the brink of madness. Sustain it with full breath, relaxed body, and open heart. Embrace your woman, if you have one, and give her what you want from her. Give it all to her. Give it away to her. Give her so much of what you want from her that you can‚Äôt tell who is who, the chaser has become the tail, and all motion stops in the intensity of self-release. There is only One. The very light of your consciousness shines as the world, and it is looking back at you, appearing as woman. She often appears as what you most fear and desire. She is the goddess, ready to fuck you, murder you, and enlighten you. Her appearance and your desire can be an endless drama of need, or they can merge, becoming a doorway to your divine source.‚Äù</li>

<h1 id="highlights">Highlights</h1>
<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>
<hr />
<p>The most valuable asset of a man in today‚Äôs world is his presence, his depth of awareness. You are not any of your identities or possessions. Know yourself as awareness. Embody yourself and let your actions come from this knowing.</p>

<p>‚ÄúA man‚Äôs worth can be found in his depth of being. A shallow man, easily perturbed and swayed, is worth less to his woman and his world than a man whose presence is deeply sourced. A profound and steady gaze conveys truth more than furtive eyes. Full, even breathing is trusted more than shallow, jittery gasps. A man grounded in the unfathomable mystery of life, in touch with death‚Äôs vastness‚Äîrather than merely flitting from one busy surface activity to another‚Äîis sourced in his depth.‚Äù ‚Äî location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B01NA993PI&amp;location=115">115</a> ^ref-38358</p>

<p>Identified with money or accomplishments, a man feels weak when he compares himself to others who have more. But when he knows himself to be self-radiant awareness, conscious and lit up, awakening as man, he blooms in perfect harmony with the immense energy of reality. The infinite force of now is his power and his presence. ‚Äî location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B01NA993PI&amp;location=126">126</a> ^ref-11063</p>

<p>Characteristics of the superior man:</p>
<ul>
  <li>purposeful</li>
  <li>confident</li>
  <li>directed</li>
  <li>integrity</li>
  <li>humorous</li>
  <li>sensitive</li>
  <li>spontaneous</li>
  <li>spiritually alive</li>
</ul>

<p>The superior man loves to take on his woman with so much love she vanishes. He is dedicated to creating love through his work and sexuality. He doesn‚Äôt hold on to his masculine nor feminine. He lives from his deepest core, committed to magnifying love.</p>

<p>[[Our culture pushes us to repress our sexuality]]</p>

<p>In the 1960‚Äôs society sought balance in 50/50 culture, men embraced the feminine and women embraced the masculine. A good thing. but this lead to confusion down the road, especially it lead to sexual neutrality.</p>

<p>[[Sexual attraction is based on sexual polarity between the masculine and the feminine]]</p>

<p>[[The loss of sexual passion stems from de-polarization between masculine and feminine]]</p>

<p>Love does not require this energetic polarity, just sex.</p>

<p>[[The masculine requires a purpose to live fully]]
[[The feminine are in search for love]]</p>

<p>Work obligations and family can kill your sexual attraction, along with spiritual depth and physical health.</p>

<p>Women in masculine roles have their femininity ‚Äúdried up‚Äù</p>

<p>You need both heart and spine to be a superior man</p>

<h2 id="1-stop-hoping-for-a-completion-of-anything-in-life">1 Stop Hoping for a Completion of Anything in Life</h2>
<hr />
<p>There is no finalization to anything. No rest. Keep making love to this life and sharing your gift.</p>

<p>Just go and give your gift. Don‚Äôt wait.</p>

<p>Men who have lived significant lives are men who never waited: not for money, security, ease, or women. Feel what you want to give most as a gift, to your woman and to the world, and do what you can to give it today. Every moment waited is a moment wasted, and each wasted moment degrades your clarity of purpose. ‚Äî location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B01NA993PI&amp;location=353">353</a> ^ref-39655</p>

<p>‚ÄúYour edge is where you stop short, or where you compromise your fullest gift, and, instead, cater to your fears.‚Äù</p>

<h2 id="5-always-hold-to-your-deepest-realization">5 Always Hold to your Deepest Realization</h2>

<p>Live from the realization of who you are (source). Take action from infinite being. Steep yourself in a spiritual life (people and books). Keep grounded in source.</p>

<p>[[Sex is a microcosm of the macrocosm of life]]</p>

<p>There are two paths:
1) Renounce the world/woman
2) Fuck both to smithereens. No gifts left ungiven. Lose and gain everything. No limit to depth of being. Die blissfully though a crucifixion of pain and pleasure.</p>
<h2 id="10-enjoy-your-friends-criticism">10 Enjoy Your Friend‚Äôs Criticism</h2>

<p><strong>If a man does not have a good relationship to masculine energy, then he will act like a woman and be hurt or defensive rather than make use of another man‚Äôs criticism.</strong></p>

<p>Your men‚Äôs team should be willing to challenge your mediocrity by suggesting concrete actions. Offer brutal honesty.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Without a life purpose, a man is lost. Adapting to events rather than creating events.</p>

<p>Your career must be aligned with your purpose</p>

<p>Recognize the truth. You are limitless consciousness. You are already full. The world or a partner cannot make you full. From this place you can give your gifts and vanish into this bliss of giving.</p>

<h2 id="12-be-willing-to-change-everything-in-your-life">12 Be Willing to Change Everything in Your Life</h2>
<hr />
<p>You must be capable of not knowing what to do in your life entering a period of unknowingness and waiting for a vision or a new form of purpose to emerge. You may need to work your way though lesser purposes to find your core purpose.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>In my case, lesser purpose might be having sex with multiple partners. My core purpose to commune with god</p>

<p>If the purpose you are following is feeling empty, boring, useless, then it should be discarded. This is a sign of growth. You then must cut into the next purpose.</p>

<p>Signs that you are completing a layer of purpose:</p>

<p>1) You suddenly have no interest whatsoever in a project or mission that, just previously, motivated you highly. 
2) ‚ÄãYou feel surprisingly free of any regrets whatsoever, for starting the project or for ending it
3) ‚ÄãEven though you may not have the slightest idea of what you are going to do next, you feel clear, unconfused, and, especially, unburdened.
4) ‚ÄãYou feel an increase in energy at the prospect of ceasing your involvement with the project.
5) The project seems almost silly, like collecting shoelaces or wallpapering your house with gas station receipts. Sure, you could do it, but why would you want to?</p>

<p>It‚Äôs okay to wait for purpose to come.</p>

<p>Crazy things happen once you find your new purpose. Connections may be made. Love may be found. Wealth may be found.</p>

<h3 id="13-dont-use-your-family-as-an-excuse">13 Don‚Äôt Use Your Family as an Excuse</h3>

<p>You may need to find your purpose before finding a woman. Purpose leads to presence which leads to a woman connecting with you.</p>

<p>[[The masculine requires a purpose to live fully]</p>

<p>For some men, their deepest life purpose is their family.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I don‚Äôt find this to be true for me, at least now</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When being with children, be fully present for whatever time you have with them. Just like your woman.</p>

<p>Discover your deepest purpose and commit yourself completely to it, and find a way to embrace your family as you do so. But don‚Äôt let your family as an excuse to be less than you can be. This would be cheating your family of your fullest core.</p>

<p>The ‚Äúdo‚Äù mode is very common among men. Both strength (to plow through obstructions) and a weakness (not present, you just become a machine). You can‚Äôt find satisfaction in completing duties and tasks (do-ing). You must relax into the awe of the mystery of existence.</p>

And this is highly valued by most men; to behold a woman free in her expression of bodily ecstasy is one of the most awesome visions most men have had.‚Äù ‚Äî location: <a href="kindle://book?action=open&amp;asin=B01NA993PI&amp;location=1210">1210</a> ^ref-41753</p>

<p>Women‚Äôs bodies are open to more sexual AND spiritual energy than men. A woman who is home in her feminine essence has no disconnection between sex and spirit. Her sexual surrender is the same as her spiritual surrender. She opens from head to toe.</p>

<h3 id="35-you-are-always-searching-for-freedom">35 You are Always Searching for Freedom</h3>
<hr />
<p>The masculine is always seeking release from constraint into freedom (orgasm, freedom from death). All masculine goals are directed toward more freedom. This is why men like war and sports (we have to get free, to the other side).</p>

<p><strong>[[Release yourself enough to relax into the depth of absolute freedom]]</strong> Relax into the depths of yourself. Your freedom. It is the end of the masculine ‚Äúgame‚Äù. By playing the game you only ‚Äútaste‚Äù this freedom.</p>

<p>The ‚Äúah‚Äù of insight in philosophy is a release into freedom!</p>

<p>Women seek love not freedom. Not emptiness but fullness. her means is not release but surrender.</p>

<p>‚ÄúHer dark side enjoys the emotional aggression in soap operas and romance novels, rather than the physical aggression of boxing matches and porno movies.‚Äù</p>

<p>[[the masculine seeks freedom, the feminine seeks love, and in the end both reach the same destination, the infinite ground of being which you are which is both absolute love and freedom]]</p>

<p>Combining masculine and feminine you add freedom to love.</p>

<p>‚ÄúIn the end, the feminine search for love and the masculine search for freedom reach the same destination: the unbounded and infinite ground of being who you are, which is both absolute love and freedom.‚Äù</p>

<h3 id="36-own-your-darkest-desires">36 Own your Darkest Desires</h3>
<hr />
<p>‚ÄúIf a man disowns his dark masculine desire for freedom, then he kinks the hose of his masculine force. His energy will not flow freely, and his attention will be bound by unfulfilled yearnings. Most importantly, if his hose is kinked in this way, he weakens his masculine capacity to stand fearless in the death that is conscious life. He will not be able to face the unknown, the groundless ground of being, and still function from his heart in love.‚Äù</p>

<p>The desire to ravish a woman is the same masculine desire to break through opponents, break through philosophical barriers to intellectual insight, break through the fear of death into spiritual freedom.</p>

<p>When the desire to ravish becomes disconnected from your heart, then you will settle for breaking through a woman‚Äôs resistances without love through violence or coercion.</p>

<p>The dark feminine desire to be raped is as strong as the dark masculine desire to rape.</p>

<p><strong>Ravishment is rape plus love.</strong></p>

<p>You have to be willing to play these dark poles in love and humor otherwise they will appear in loveless ways.</p>

<p><strong>You must be as fearless with your sexual desire as you are with your spiritual desire</strong>, Don‚Äôt be afraid to lose yourself with your woman into the unknowable infinity beyond the mind. Most men are.<img src="/assets/images/20240716_133223.jpg" alt="blah" /></p>

<p>When you make love, feel through your own boundaries into her. feel her so deeply you are aware of her breath, movements, her emotions.</p>

<p>Allow love to ravish your woman to bursting, filling her beyond capacity. let go of all fear, giving only love.</p>

<p>Allow both dark and light desires.</p>

<p>By reclaiming the full force of masculine loving, you will re-own your capacity to ravish your woman and you will re-own your spiritual guts.</p>

<p>‚ÄúTo truly ravish your woman in love, you must yield yourself in the worship and trust of her heart, which, in truth, is your heart. Such fearlessness will prepare you for and perhaps even initiate you into the worship and trust of consciousness itself, such that you will find greater and greater capacity to yield into and as the boundless One who you truly are.‚Äù</p>

<h3 id="37-she-wants-the-killer-in-you">37 She wants the ‚ÄúKiller‚Äù in You</h3>
<hr />
<p>Fearlessness is a quintessential form of the ultimate masculine gift. Fearlessness is the capacity to transcend the fear of death for the sake of love.</p>

<p>Today‚Äôs society creates wimpy men.</p>

<p>‚ÄúBut beneath the nice veneer of most women lies the wrathful goddess who would chop the head off of every mediocre ‚Äúnew age‚Äù man. And beneath the patient smile of most men lies the warrior of love who would ravish his woman into bliss rather than listen to her chat in pointless emotional circles‚Äù</p>

<p><strong>The dark masculine energy has been suppressed nowadays</strong></p>

<p>Your woman wants to feel your capacity to stand strong in your own desires and ravish her because you love her, unafraid of her dark energy. She wants to know your capacity to <strong>face and know death</strong>. The knowledge of death strips the armor from your heart and allows the knowledge of love..</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is why I should get back into flying. OWN it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>‚ÄúThe ‚Äúkiller‚Äù your woman wants is the one who knows that life is a process of dying through to that which cannot be lost. Only in this sacrifice of fear can your heart remain unguarded.

<p><strong>She wants your consciousness (clear strong and free) as much as you want he radiance.</strong> If you are not penetrating her moods, she can‚Äôt feel your consciousness.</p>

<p><strong>You must communicate your consciousness through your body. Your fearlessness and strength of love must manifest though your body.</strong> ‚ÄúIf you walk up to her, hold her in your arms, and laugh affectionately in the humor of the moment, she will feel your freedom, if it is for real.

And in relationship with such a woman, there are no bounds to the rapture which may resonate through your union.

<hr />
<p>Use her attractiveness as a slingshot through her appearance into source.</p>

<p>Women cannot satisfy you absolutely. NOTHING CAN :)</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe play of your body wanting her body is the most obvious hoax of fulfillment‚Äù</p>

<p>Women are the epitome of appearance, and all appearances seem to promise you something you want. But it is the source behind the appearance you are looking for.</p>

<p>‚ÄúYou are least unhappy when you are relieved of the need to get anything at all from appearance.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúYou are chasing your own tail, and much of the time that tail looks suspiciously like a woman‚Äù</p>

<p><strong>But do NOT stop chasing</strong></p>

<p>‚ÄúYour ultimate desire is for the union of consciousness with its own luminosity, wherein all appearance is recognized as your deep, blissful nature, and there is only One. Your desire for union with a woman is a stepped-down version of this ultimate spiritual need. You can use your desire as a doorway to spiritual oneness. Magnify your desiring to the brink of madness. Sustain it with full breath, relaxed body, and open heart. Embrace your woman, if you have one, and give her what you want from her. Give it all to her. Give it away to her. Give her so much of what you want from her that you can‚Äôt tell who is who, the chaser has become the tail, and all motion stops in the intensity of self-release. There is only One. The very light of your consciousness shines as the world, and it is looking back at you, appearing as woman. She often appears as what you most fear and desire. She is the goddess, ready to fuck you, murder you, and enlighten you. Her appearance and your desire can be an endless drama of need, or they can merge, becoming a doorway to your divine source.‚Äù</p>

<p><strong>Other is a mirage. feel through other to get to oneness,</strong></p>

<p>‚ÄúThe revelation of deep oneness is love.‚Äù</p>

<p>Appearances are distractions (tits, ass, wealth, fame). Bow down through them into the deep which only seems to have been an other. For there is only the one.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Physical</li>
  <li>Spiritual</li>
  <li>Relational</li>
</ul>

<p>On relational:
The woman knows she can deplete him, empty him of life force. She feels he cannot be trusted because both she and the world can deplete and depolarize him.</p>

<p>[[Dont ejaculate to preserve the polarity in your relationship. Because she cannot put out your fire]]</p>

<p>Wit<img src="/assets/images/20240820_144524.jpg" alt="blah" />hout ejaculating, you build up energy to ‚Äúcut through‚Äù the obstructions of life to give your gift.
‚ÄúIn a subtle way, excess ejaculations will diminish your courage to take risks, professionally and spiritually.‚Äù</p>

<p>What ravishes your woman is invading her body with your consciousness. Not your semen.</p>

<p>if your woman knows you can allow temporary pleasures to diminish your capacity for her, she knows you will succumb to the world as well.</p>

<p>You are to endlessly ravish her and the world.</p>

<p>Avoid women who refuse your loving.</p>

<p>‚ÄúYour masculine sexual gift is to coax, humor, shock, and caress her love into melting through her layers of fear. Without imposing your own needs on her, let your love penetrate to the deep part of her that is totally open to love, that is love itself, and coax it to the fore. Do this slowly, over time, not through conversation, but through bodily communicated presence, care, consciousness, and the liquid loving of sexual intermingling. When she feels the absolutely trustable nature of your loving‚Äîthat you are truly with her, committed to loving, and you‚Äôre not going to get lost in the self-enclosed spasm of your own pleasurizing‚Äîshe will begin to trust you with her most vulnerable core.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúEvery time she sucks you into an uncontrollable need to ejaculate, she has conquered you. She controls you and masters you. She is in charge, sexually, no matter what manly gestures you make before ejaculating. With a simple flick of her tongue, a silky moan, or a slurping tilt of her pelvis, she can drain you of life. And, deep down, she knows the world can do the same to you.‚Äù</p>

<p>Do not surrender for less than the total surrender of her heart and your own into the fullness of divine union. The pleasures of this far exceed the typical genital pleasures.</p>

<p>if you are addicted to ejaculation, your woman will be sexually emotionally and spiritually unfulfilled.</p>

<p>Convert depletive ejaculatory orgasms into rejuvenative orgasms, through contracting the pelvic floor and drawing energy up the spine.</p>

<p>Best definition of premature ejaculation: ‚ÄúIf your ejaculation signs the end to your session of loving before both you and your woman have fully opened yourselves, then your ejaculation is premature‚Äù</p>

<p>We are conditioned as teenagers that ejaculation is the goal, to release tension.</p>

<p>To realize the full potential of sex, you need to learn how to recondition your body and nervous system to unhabitualize the mechanics of ejaculation and convert orgasm into massive energy.</p>

<p>Step 1: Relax muscles instead of tensing up
Step 2: Redirect your attention to feel your partner rather than your own sensations</p>

<p>With practice you will be able to [[feel through your partner during sex]]</p>

<p>A large part of avoiding PE is to breathe fully, deeply, and with great force throughout the day</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Breathwork?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Inhale down the front of your body, filling belly and genitals. Exhale up your spine.</p>

<p>Sex increases the life force in your body, tending to be more focused in the genitals. you need to be careful to not let it build up and therefore move the energy.</p>

<p>You need to practice both contracting your pelvic floor AND also pulling the entire floor upwards towards your body.</p>

<p>#==‚ÄùWhile you are having sex, but before you are close to ejaculating, practice contracting your pelvic floor as just discussed. While you contract it and pull upward, breathe the energy up your spine. You will have to experiment to determine whether to inhale or to exhale the energy up your spine, although most people find that exhaling up the spine works best. If you combine the upward contraction of your pelvic floor with breathing up your spine, you should lose just a little bit of your erection as well as the need to ejaculate. As you continue making love, repeat this exercise as often as you need to in order to maintain relaxation and openness. Even while practicing this technique, you may notice that you occasionally come very close to having an orgasm. At this point, stop moving, apply the upward contraction of your pelvic floor, and breathe the orgasm energy up your spine. In addition to the upward contraction of your pelvic floor while breathing up the spine, some men find it helpful to clench their fists and teeth while looking upward with their eyes, especially when the urge toward ejaculation is particularly strong. With practice, however, all the muscular action becomes very subtle and gentle, until the entire exercise is done primarily through your breath, feeling, and intention. When the energy shoots up your spine, relax and enjoy the colors, feelings, and blisses that will fill your head and rain down through your body. Once you are proficient at this exercise, you can evoke the same sensations in your partner by feeling into your partner from your heart as the orgasm shoots up your spine. The upward movement of your energy will magnetize the same movement in hers. These practices will not be successful unless you are able to surrender as love in the midst of sexual embrace. Love is the governor of energy. More and more, you must practice being love in the form of sexual coupling. Regardless of how tough your day has been, regardless of the burdens you face in your life, sexing should be a time of practicing love. Like meditation or prayer, sex should be a special time of practicing opening your heart and giving love fully, into and through your partner, and in communion with that which you hold most sacred. If your heart is closed, your energy will be obstructed, and you will never be able to convert your spurt to a lightning bolt of love. If you don‚Äôt practice love, your sexual energy will be governed by old habits of body and emotion, which are all about the tiny commotion of ejaculation. So, if you want to expand sexual bliss as fully as possible, remember that your emotional disposition is far more important than the technical exercises themselves.‚Äù==</p>

<p><strong>These practices require you to be able to surrender as love within a sexual embrace.</strong></p>

<p>This requires experimentation and practice, but it is SOO worth it.</p>

<p>1) ‚ÄãRather than fantasizing or entertaining inward sexual imagery of any kind, remain totally present, aware of your own body, breath, and mind, and especially attentive to your partner. Break the masturbatory habit of inward fantasy by consciously practicing sex as a relational play of love with your partner. 
2) ‚ÄãKeep your body and breath relaxed and full. Especially keep the front of your body relaxed, so that your belly is vast and your heart is soft and wide. This will help prevent too much tension from accumulating in any one area.
3) ‚ÄãLearn to feel into, and then through, your partner, so that your attention is directed beyond your own sensations and even beyond your partner‚Äôs sensations. Practice feeling outward, without limit, as if you were feeling to infinity. In other words, whatever you are feeling, feel it fully, and then feel through and beyond it, so that sex becomes a constant feeling through and beyond every sensation, rather than focusing on any particular sensation. 
4) Throughout the day and during the sexual session, practice breathing so that your inhalation moves energy down the front of your body and the exhalation moves energy up your spine. Excessive, chronic thinking or addiction to ejaculation is often a sign that your energy is blocked and you are not yet breathing fully in this circle throughout the day.
5) During sex, occasionally practice the upward contraction of the floor of your pelvis while breathing sexual energy up your spine, so it fills your whole body. Especially as you begin to approach orgasm, you can combine the upward contraction of your pelvic floor with breathing up the spine in order to shoot your orgasm up into your brain, and even out through the top of your head, rather than down and out your genitals. This upward orgasm will then feel like it is gently seeping down through every cell of your body, saturating you with thick open light.‚Äù</p>

<p>[[the masculine seeks freedom, the feminine seeks love, and in the end both reach the same destination, the infinite ground of being which you are which is both absolute love and freedom]]</p>

<p>To the masculine, purpose is primary. Intimacy is enjoyed only in addition to your purpose. To a woman, intimacy is at the core of her life. This is the primacy asymmetry.</p>

<p>A man‚Äôs priority is his mission, so he will gravitate to a woman who he feels would support his mission.</p>

<p>A man has many options for intimacy. A woman has only one.</p>

Your main gift is to guide her moment by moment out of her moods and into the openness of loving.</p>

<p>A woman can get you out of your head and into your body through her touch, loving, attractiveness. Bring you into presense.</p>

<hr />
<p>Rather than wanting ‚Äúhis way‚Äù, a superior man wants the ‚Äúgrowth way‚Äù for his woman, directing her into more love and happiness.</p>

<p>Men get too focused on the grind. Women get too focused on their moods. You must cut-through the grind to remember your purpose and you must cut-through her moods to her love.</p>

<p>==‚ÄùYou are entirely responsible for cutting through your own laziness, addictions, and unclarity‚Äù==</p>

<p>‚ÄúYou could meditate until you‚Äôre blue in the face, but it won‚Äôt work, if, when it comes down to it, you‚Äôd rather masturbate, read the newspaper, or watch TV than cut through your addictions, discipline your daily life, and give your gift from your deepest, most blissful source. The quality of your intent and the consistency and depth of your application determine the results of your direction in gifting‚Äîas well as your capacity to guide your woman‚Äôs life into greater happiness and bodily surrender into love.‚Äù</p>

<hr />
<p>‚ÄúA man rediscovers and fine tunes his purpose in solitude, in challenging situations, and in the company of other men who won‚Äôt settle for his bullshit. But women strengthen their feminine radiance best in the company of other women in mutual celebration and play. A man must arrange for both forms of restoration: his own solitude and men‚Äôs gatherings, and his woman‚Äôs time with other women.‚Äù</p>

<p>If woman and man spend too much time with each other, they become neutralized.</p>

<p>Singing and dancing in the woods to reclaim your feminine. Remain in isolation and challenge yourself and live in austerity to reclaim your masculine.</p>

<p>‚ÄúUnadorned suffering is the bedmate of masculine growth‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúFeel your suffering, rest with it, embrace it, make love with it. Feel your suffering so deeply and thoroughly that you penetrate it, and realize its fearful foundation. Almost everything you do, you do because you are afraid to die. And yet dying is exactly what you are doing, from the moment you are born. Two hours of absorption in a good Super Bowl telecast may distract you temporarily, but the fact remains. You were born as a sacrifice. And you can either participate in the sacrifice, dissolving in the giving of your gift, or you can resist it, which is your suffering.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúMake sure that you arrange for your woman‚Äôs rejuvenative time and your own. Otherwise, you will rot in the cushions of bargained stagnation and sexual neutralization which pad your true edge of living your gift in relationship.‚Äù</p>
