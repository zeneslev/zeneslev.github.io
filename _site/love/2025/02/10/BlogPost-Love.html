<p>Love and relationship in my view. God as a many limbed being, waving her hands around. Limbs are quite long, sometimes at great lengths from God. The limbs forget.. Once in a while two limbs smack into each other. One limb gets to know the other limb and has a realization. They are both part of the same being! “Wow”</p>

<p>Not all limbs fit with eachother. Not all mind-bodys are compatible.</p>

<p>I art thou</p>
